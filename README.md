# Data Analyst Journey

Welcome! This repo tracks my journey to becoming a **Data Analyst**.  
I’m learning and practicing **SQL, Excel, and Business Analytics** through structured self-study, projects, and weekly progress logs.

---

## Current Focus
- **SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)**  
  Joins, aggregations, GROUP BY vs PARTITION BY, window functions, and hybrid queries (CTEs + windows).  
- **Excel**  
  Data cleaning (TRIM, PROPER, SUBSTITUTE, validation), pivot tables, formulas, dashboards.  
- **Business Insights**  
  Translating data into decisions, asking the right business questions, building portfolio-ready case studies.

## Skills Learned So Far
### SQL
- Querying: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`  
- Aggregations: `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`  
- Joins: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL  
- Window Functions: `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `SUM() OVER`  
- Hybrid Queries: Combining `GROUP BY` + `PARTITION BY` with CTEs  

### Excel
- Core Functions: `SUMIF`, `SUMIFS`, `VLOOKUP`, `INDEX-MATCH`, `IF`  
- Data Cleaning: `TRIM`, `PROPER`, `SUBSTITUTE`, handling dates/numbers/text  
- Validation: phone numbers, email cleanup, duplicate handling  
- Pivot Tables & Charts: summarizing and visualizing data  
- Dashboards: simple KPI views and reporting setups  

### Analytics & Insights
- Framing business questions before querying/analysis  
- Translating results into clear decisions  
- Tracking weekly progress with a growth mindset

## About Me
I’ve always been drawn to numbers and patterns. This repo reflects my journey learning how to apply those interests to **business problems and data storytelling**.  

Currently working full-time and balancing family life with my 1-year-old — building consistency and progress one step at a time.
