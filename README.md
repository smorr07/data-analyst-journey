# Data Analyst Journey 

Welcome! This repo tracks my journey to becoming a **Data Analyst**. I’m learning and practicing **SQL, Excel, and Business Analytics** through structured self-study, projects, and guided training.  

# Current Focus

- SQL (Microsoft SQL Server – querying, joins, aggregations, window functions)  
- Excel (data cleaning, pivot tables, formulas, dashboards)  
- Business Insights (translating data into decisions, asking the right questions)  

# Progress Tracker
- [x] Setup GitHub repository  
- [X] SQL Basics – `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`  
- [ ] SQL Aggregations – `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`  
- [ ] Excel Formulas & Functions  
- [ ] Excel Pivot Tables  
- [ ] First End-to-End Project (SQL + Excel + Insights)  

# Projects
This section will grow as I add completed exercises and projects:  
- **SQL Practice:** Queries, challenges, and notes will live in `/sql/`  
- **Excel Projects:** Files and dashboards will live in `/excel/`  
- **Case Studies:** Business insight write-ups will live in `/insights/`  


# About Me
I’ve always had an interest in numbers and patterns. I’m excited to learn how to apply these interests to **business problems and data storytelling**.  
Currently working full-time and balancing family life with my 1-year-old — building consistency and progress one step at a time.
