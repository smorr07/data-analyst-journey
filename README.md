# Data Analyst Journey  

Welcome! This repo tracks my journey to becoming a Data Analyst.  
Iâ€™m learning and practicing SQL, Excel, and Business Analytics through structured self-study, projects, and weekly progress logs.

---

## Current Focus  

### SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)
- Applying advanced SQL (CTEs, window functions) to real-world datasets like AdventureWorks.  
- Building queries that compare planned vs actual performance (manufacturing, sales, operations).  

### Excel
- Translating SQL query outputs into pivot tables, charts, and metrics.  
- Practicing data storytelling â€” summarizing, visualizing, and explaining key business patterns.  

### Business Insights
- Exploring production efficiency, quality metrics, and performance delays.  
- Learning to form testable business questions, interpret data patterns, and communicate findings.

## Skills Learned So Far  

### SQL
- Querying: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`  
- Aggregations: `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`  
- Joins: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`  
- Window Functions: `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `SUM() OVER`  
- Hybrid Queries: Combining `GROUP BY` + `PARTITION BY` with CTEs  
- Advanced Querying: `COALESCE`, `DATEDIFF`, and nested aggregations inside CTEs  
- Practical Applications: Comparing expected vs actual performance metrics  

### Excel
- Core Functions: `SUMIF`, `SUMIFS`, `VLOOKUP`, `IF`  
- Data Cleaning: `TRIM`, `PROPER`, `SUBSTITUTE`, handling dates/numbers/text  
- Validation: phone numbers, email cleanup, duplicate handling  
- Pivot Tables & Charts: summarizing and visualizing SQL outputs  
- Dashboards: simple KPI views and reporting setups  

### Analytics & Insights
- Framing business questions before querying/analysis  
- Translating results into clear, data-driven decisions  
- Root Cause Analysis: investigating performance delays and inefficiencies  
- Data Storytelling: summarizing SQL + Excel findings into business insights  
- Tracking weekly progress with a growth mindset

## Recent Milestone  

**Completed first end-to-end analysis using AdventureWorks2022**  
- Built advanced SQL queries (CTEs, joins, DATEDIFF, COALESCE).  
- Exported results to Excel for visualization.  
- Analyzed manufacturing delays, scrap rates, and process efficiency.  
**Next Step:** Expand into business case studies with visuals and storytelling.

## Progress Tracker  

- **Week 1 â†’** SQL basics (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`), Excel formulas (`SUMIF`, `VLOOKUP`).  
- **Week 2 â†’** SQL aggregations, `GROUP BY` vs `PARTITION BY`, window functions, hybrid queries, Excel data cleaning (names, numbers, dates, emails).  
- **Week 3 â†’** Completed SQL join challenges and hybrid `GROUP BY`/`PARTITION BY` exercises, drafted first end-to-end project question using AdventureWorks (manufacturing delays), and organized GitHub updates for SQL, Excel, and progress logs.  
- **Week 4 â†’** Completed full SQL manufacturing delay analysis using AdventureWorks2022. Built queries to compare expected vs actual days to manufacture, analyzed scrap rates, and exported results to Excel for pivot-based insights. Practiced interpreting production delay patterns and data reliability issues.

## Projects  

### Manufacturing Delay Analysis (AdventureWorks2022)
- SQL project comparing expected vs actual manufacturing times.  
- Integrated Excel pivot analysis to explore delay causes and scrap patterns.  
- First step toward an end-to-end portfolio case study.  

### Upcoming
- Business case studies with data storytelling.  
- Interactive dashboards (Excel, possibly Power BI).

## Tools  

- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
- Microsoft Excel  
- GitHub (portfolio & progress tracking)

## About Me  

Iâ€™ve always been drawn to numbers and patterns. This repo reflects my journey learning how to apply those interests to business problems and data storytelling.  

Currently working full-time and balancing family life with my 1-year-old â€” building consistency and progress one step at a time.
