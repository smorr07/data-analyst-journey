# Progress Log – Data Analyst Journey

This log documents my weekly progress in learning data analytics (SQL, Excel, Business Insights) as I work toward a remote Data Analyst role.

# Format
- **Week # / Date Range**
- Achievements (skills learned, projects completed, milestones hit)
- Next Steps (what I’ll tackle next week)
- Reflections (insights, blockers, or lessons learned)

# Week 1 (Sept 1 – Sept 7, 2025)
- Achievements:
  - Set up GitHub repository with structured folders (`sql`, `excel`, `insights`).
  - Completed SQL basics quiz (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY).
  - Drafted professional README files for each folder.
- Next Steps:
  - Begin SQL aggregation queries (SUM, COUNT, GROUP BY).
  - Practice Excel formulas (SUMIF, VLOOKUP).
- Reflections:
  - Biggest lesson: consistency matters more than intensity.
  - Challenge: balancing study with work and family — short focused sprints work best.

# Week 2 (Sept 8 – Sept 14, 2025)

- Achievements:
  - Practiced Excel formulas beyond the basics: SUMIFS, IF, TRIM, PROPER, SUBSTITUTE.
  - Cleaned messy datasets: standardized phone numbers, validated email addresses, split inconsistent name fields.
  - Built pivot tables to analyze regional sales and sort revenue.
  - Completed a “challenge round” Excel dataset simulating real-world messy data.
  - Strengthened SQL understanding of GROUP BY vs. PARTITION BY and practiced hybrid queries with CTEs + window functions.
  - Learned and applied ranking functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK) in customer and product sales analysis.
- Next Steps:
  - More practice with Excel messy datasets (focus on dates, product codes, and missing values).
  - SQL practice combining joins with window functions.
  - Begin introducing business insights questions to practice asking the “why” behind the data.

- Reflections:
  - Realized Excel data cleaning builds the same mindset needed in SQL query writing.
  - Learning to slow down and ask clarifying questions before writing queries has improved accuracy.
  - Time continues to be tight, but short focused study blocks are working well.
