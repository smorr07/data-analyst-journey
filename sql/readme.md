This folder contains SQL exercises, scripts, and practice queries completed as part of my data analytics learning journey.  
Topics will progress from fundamentals to advanced concepts, including:

- Basic SELECT statements and filtering
- Aggregations and GROUP BY
- JOINs and subqueries
- Window functions
- Case studies and applied business problems

Each file is numbered to reflect learning progression (e.g., `01_basics_select.sql`).
