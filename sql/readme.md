This folder contains SQL exercises, scripts, and practice queries completed as part of my data analytics learning journey.  
Topics will progress from fundamentals to advanced concepts, including:

- Basic SELECT statements and filtering
- Aggregations and GROUP BY
- JOINs and subqueries
- Window functions
- Case studies and applied business problems

Each file is numbered to reflect learning progression (e.g., `01_select_basics.sql`).

- Join Types Practiced:
  - INNER JOIN – return only matching rows
  - LEFT / RIGHT JOIN – retain all rows from one side
  - FULL OUTER JOIN – include unmatched rows from both sides
- Advanced Patterns:
  - JOIN + GROUP BY for product sales counts
  - COALESCE with SUM/COUNT to replace NULLs
